ATM Simulation in Python

This is a simple ATM simulation program written in Python that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as withdrawal, deposit, PIN generation, and viewing a mini statement.

Features

Withdrawal: Users can withdraw money from their account after entering a valid PIN.

Deposit: Users can deposit money into their account.

PIN Generation: Users can set up a PIN if they don't have one.

Mini Statement: Users can view their account details and balance.


How to Use

1. Run the Python script.


2. Select an option from the menu:

Press 1 for Withdrawal

Press 2 for Deposit

Press 3 for PIN Generation

Press 4 for Mini Statement

Press 5 to Exit



3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the desired transaction.



Account Information

The script contains predefined accounts stored in a dictionary with the following format:

accounts = {
    1001 : ["User 1","24-08-2024",10000,2408],
    1002 : ["User 2","16-07-2024",20000,1234],
    1003 : ["User 3","20-01-2024",5000,None]    
}

Each account has a name, date of birth, balance, and PIN (if set).

If the PIN is None, the user must generate a new PIN before accessing the account.


Requirements

Python 3.x


Running the Script

Save the script as atm.py and run it using:

python atm.py

Future Improvements

Implement a database instead of using a dictionary.

Add transaction history logging.

Introduce a user-friendly graphical interface.
